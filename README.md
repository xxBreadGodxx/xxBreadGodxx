<div>

- Learning how to code alittle bit of everything all of the time.

- Usually coding in c# and now c++, messed around with java, python, and html enough to hold a conversation.

- Trying to stay occupied all the time, so I make whatever comes to mind if I'm able.

- Hyperfocusing is key especially when it gives you super powers to learn as fast as I do...

- Lan party when?
